# local-government-online-apps

This subset of our open source software helps local governments provide web applications to their citizens via Esri's ArcGIS Online ecosystem, a place where individuals and organizations can create maps and applications to share on the Internet.

[![Image of Local Government Online App using the 'Finder' configuration][FinderThumbnail]][FinderPreview] [![Image of Local Government Online App using the 'Find, Edit, and Filter' configuration][FEFThumbnail]][FEFPreview]

## Features

* Runs in the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers ([supported browsers][], except IE 11) on browser screens from phone through tablet to desktop. (Find, Edit, and Filter is currently for desktop only.)
* Permits multiple levels of customization:
    1. publication configuration: titles and icons by configuring the web application using the standard ArcGIS online configuration program
    2. advanced configuration: adjustment of application styles and content, visibility of components
    3. unlimited modifications to the open source

The first two levels can be done whether the app is hosted on your server or in ArcGIS Online.

Currently, two application configurations are provided:

* Finder (formerly called Parcel Viewer) *[preview the application][FinderPreview]*
* Find, Edit, and Filter *[preview the application][FEFPreview]*
